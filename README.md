- Bash (To execute the git commands)
- HTML 5 (Structure)
- CSS 3 (Styling)
- JavaScript (Minor element behaviors/animation)

### Structuring Process
1. Create an index.html file for setting up the basic structure of the webpage. It must contain the following sections:
    - About 
    - Skills
    - Projects
    - Contact
2. Create a suitable navigation bar (header) with the respective section links and a suitable footer.
Note: I've added meta tags to the header to make the website SEO friendly
3. Add the necessary links to the navbar, add social media links.
4. Create a sitemap of the site and link it at the bottom.

### Design Process
1. I've decided to follow the Swiss ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ design principles.
2. Choose a Sans Serif font for better readability and simplicity.
3. Select a primary color and a seconday color that can be used for the Call-To-Action (CTA).
(I decided to go with a gradient of Glory Red and Glory Blue to show my bold and cool personality to be blended in one.)
4. Create divs to make our job styling easier
5. Decided to go with an interactive menu system like section for the About Me.
6. Decided to add an experience section as I have real world experience through internships, and most of my projects are proprietary

### Deployment
1. Go to GitHub Pages
2. Select the source as the Main branch and the /root directory
3. Wait for some 5 odd minutes until Jekyll builds your file and serves it at GitHub's own domain with your repo name.

## Reflection on Learning
1. Having a prototype design either in Figma/Canva and looking at inspiration before designing is helpful.
2. Creating specific divs with their own classes help style the elements more accurately.
3. Always have the script at the bottom to help with a faster First Contentful Paint (FCS).
4. Use "rem" instead of "px" to help in building responsive sizes for elements.
5. Import Bootstrap JS element to implement carousel as it's much more efficient and faster (+easier to code).
6. Break down your code by having comments!!! Improves readability and findability if you want to make any changes.
7. Use a constant color scheme to make it look professional, otherwise it'll look messy.
8. Ensure the a links have target="_blank" to make sure when they visit those links it opens in a new tab, not closing the site.
9. Have an accessible Menu bar, prefarably at thumb reach based on User Interface Guidelines from Apple.
10. Look wholistically at the design, and learn about how each section can seamlessly transform into another. And use Bootstrap to make it responsive.
