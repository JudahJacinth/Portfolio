### Structuring Process
1. Create an index.html file for setting up the basic structure of the webpage. It must contain the following sections:
    - About 
    - Skills
    - Projects
    - Contact
2. Create a suitable navigation bar (header) with the respective section links and a suitable footer.
Note: I've added meta tags to the header to make the website SEO friendly
3. Add the necessary links to the navbar, add social media links.
4. Create a sitemap of the site and link it at the bottom.

### Design Process
1. I've decided to follow the Swiss design principles.
2. Choose a Sans Serif font for better readability and simplicity.
3. Select a primary color and a seconday color that can be used for the Call-To-Action (CTA).
